Concern	Rigity Level	Impact	Resolution 
Hardcoded Map SVG	Very Rigid	Critical 	"Pivot this to a ""hero"" approach that is configureable by JSON.
Use type: "".."" to power approach (inside JSON) 
options for ""type"": [""image"", ""svg"", ""roughSVG"", ""lottie""
Conder how we can ensure all 'types' animate correctly (maybe step back from current drawOn mechnaic in this instance) "
Two-line question format	Rigid	High	"Render question structure dynamic 
Loop through lines array (1-4max) and calculate stagger based on length
Choregraph smooth animations dynamically"
All component positions fixed	Rigid	High 	"Include position tokens in JSON from all  pre-calculated positions on a 9 point square  (top left -> centre -> bottom right)
Attach to all rendered components in the scene (header, subtitle, images etc) "
Question Exit hardcoded	Somewhat	Low 	All question exit animations will exit left. Allow customisation based on preset exit options and configure in JSON. 
Font Scaling Manual	Low 	Low 	Long strings need manual size tweaks, but we should be able to add config to do this outside of this review.
