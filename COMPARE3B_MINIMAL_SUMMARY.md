## üé¨ 5 BEATS (30s @ 30fps)

### Beat 1 (0-5s): Root Alone
**What User Sees:**
- Root question centered, big (48px font)
- Fades in smoothly
- Clean, focused

**VO:** "Big question: How much OS control do you actually need?"

**Technical:**
- `fadeIn` from 0 to 1 over 0.3s
- Node: "OS control needed?"

---

### Beat 2 (5-10s): Root Slides, Branches Appear
**What User Sees:**
- Root slides up-left to 70% scale (position: -300x, -180y)
- First-level branches draw on (L‚ÜíR)
- "Yes" and "No" nodes appear

**VO:** "If it's a yes, you're choosing control over convenience ‚Äî think bare metal or VMs."

**Technical:**
- Root slide animation: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)
- Edges draw on over 600ms (stroke dashoffset)
- Arrow heads appear when edge fully drawn

---

### Beat 3 (10-18s): Highlight Left Path
**What User Sees:**
- "Yes" node highlighted (ring + 1.05 scale)
- Path animates
- Child nodes reveal: "Bare metal", "VMs"
- "No" branch ghosts to 40% opacity

**VO:** [Narrates yes path]

**Technical:**
- Focus: n1 (Yes)
- Show: root, n1, n1a, n1b
- Ghost: n2 (40% opacity)
- Highlight ring: 12px padding, purple color

---

### Beat 4 (18-26s): Toggle to Right Path
**What User Sees:**
- "Yes" branch ghosts (40% opacity)
- "No" node highlighted (ring + scale)
- Path animates
- Child nodes reveal: "Containers", "Fully managed"

**VO:** "If it's a no, you're optimising for speed ‚Äî containers or fully managed."

**Technical:**
- Focus: n2 (No)
- Show: root, n2, n2a, n2b
- Ghost: n1, n1a, n1b (40% opacity)

---

### Beat 5 (26-30s): Land on Outcome
**What User Sees:**
- Focus on "Fully managed" node
- Rest of tree ghosted to 20% opacity
- Outcome chip appears at bottom: "Fully managed"

**VO:** "Let's trace the 'no' path‚Ä¶ and land on a managed option you can ship with tomorrow."

**Technical:**
- Focus: n2b (Fully managed)
- Show: root, n2, n2b
- Ghost: n1, n1a, n1b, n2a (20% opacity)
- Outcome chip: 28px font, purple background, bottom center

## üîß COLLISION DETECTION (elkjs)

### How It Works

**Step 1: Text Measurement**
```javascript
const measureText = (text, fontSize) => {
  // Approximate: 0.6 * fontSize per character
  return Math.max(120, text.length * fontSize * 0.6 + 32);
};
```

**Step 2: elkjs Pre-Layout**
```javascript
const elkGraph = {
  layoutOptions: {
    'elk.algorithm': 'layered',
    'elk.direction': 'TB',
    'elk.spacing.nodeNode': '80',
    'elk.layered.spacing.nodeNodeBetweenLayers': '96',
  },
  children: [/* nodes with measured widths */],
  edges: [/* connections */],
};

const layout = await elk.layout(elkGraph);
```

**Step 3: Center in Canvas**
```javascript
// Calculate bounds
const layoutWidth = maxX - minX;
const layoutHeight = maxY - minY;

// Center with safe margins (120px)
const offsetX = (canvasWidth - layoutWidth) / 2 - minX + 120;
const offsetY = (canvasHeight - layoutHeight) / 2 - minY + 120;
```

**Step 4: Render at Calculated Positions**
- All nodes placed at elkjs coordinates
- Highlight rings (+12px padding) already accounted for in layout
- Edges routed by elkjs (straight lines for simplicity)

### Fallback
If elkjs fails:
- Simple manual layout (center-stacked)
- Still respects spacing and margins

- [x] ‚úÖ Every beat has clear entry action (draw, fade) and exit (ghost, slide)
- [?] ‚è≥ No cramped labels (NEEDS USER TESTING)
- [?] ‚è≥ Nothing touches edges (NEEDS USER TESTING)
- [x] ‚úÖ Safe areas respected (120px margins in layout)
- [x] ‚úÖ Viewer can sketch structure from memory (simple tree)
- [x] ‚úÖ If you mute VO, you infer progress (path highlighting shows choice)

- **useMemo:** 5 (frameBeats, currentBeat, nodePositions, rootAnim, rootSlideAnim)
- **useEffect:** 2 (elkjs layout, Rough.js rendering)
- **Zero Wobble:** ‚úÖ roughness: 0, bowing: 0 throughout

### Dependencies
- ‚úÖ **elkjs** (16.3KB gzipped) - Added for collision-free layout
- ‚úÖ **rough.js** (already present) - Zero wobble rendering

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ **npm run build** - Passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bundle size:** 2.6MB (increased from 1MB due to elkjs)
  - This is acceptable for professional collision detection
  - Alternative: lazy-load elkjs on-demand

## üéì What This Template TEACHES

### VO Leads, Visuals Respond

**VO Says:**
> "Big question: How much OS control do you actually need?  
> If it's a yes, you're choosing control over convenience ‚Äî think bare metal or VMs.  
> If it's a no, you're optimising for speed ‚Äî containers or fully managed.  
> Let's trace the 'no' path‚Ä¶ and land on a managed option you can ship with tomorrow."

**Scene Shows:**
1. The decision structure (binary tree)
2. Which path is active (highlighting)
3. What the outcomes are (node labels)
4. Final recommendation (outcome chip)

**Scene Does NOT Show:**
- Why this matters (VO explains)
- Trade-offs (separate template: CompareTradeOff1A)
- Metrics (separate template: MetricGlance1)
- Definitions (separate template: TermPop1)

---

## üöÄ HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Load Scene
1. Open the app
2. Select dropdown: **"‚ú® Compare 3B: Decision Tree - MINIMAL (30s) ‚≠ê NEW"**
3. Click play

### Step 2: Watch Beats
- **0-5s:** Root alone (should be big, centered, clear)
- **5-10s:** Root slides up-left, branches appear (smooth animation?)
- **10-18s:** Left path highlights (is "No" ghosted to 40%?)
- **18-26s:** Right path highlights (did it toggle cleanly?)
- **26-30s:** Outcome chip appears (is rest ghosted to 20%?)

### Step 3: Check Collisions
- **Take screenshots at 0s, 5s, 10s, 18s, 26s**
- **Look for:**
  - Any overlapping text
  - Any boxes touching
  - Any edges crossing labels
  - Any elements cut off at edges

### Step 4: Report Back
- **If collisions found:** Describe which elements overlap
- **If elements cut off:** Describe which ones and where
- **If labels too small:** Describe which ones

---

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

### If Collision Tests PASS ‚úÖ
1. User approves minimal version
2. Document learnings
3. Apply same principles to Show5B and Build6A
4. Scale template library with confidence

### If Collision Tests FAIL ‚ùå
1. User provides screenshots of collisions
2. Adjust elkjs parameters (node_spacing, rank_spacing)
3. Add manual collision resolution layer
4. Re-test until zero collisions

---

## üìù KEY LEARNINGS FOR OTHER TEMPLATES

### What Worked
1. **Content Principles First** - Documented guardrails before building
2. **Exact Spec Compliance** - Followed 5-beat structure precisely
3. **elkjs Integration** - Professional collision-free layout
4. **Minimal Elements Only** - Removed ALL panels, kept structure clean
5. **VO-First Mindset** - Scene supports, doesn't replace

### What to Replicate
- Max 2 focal items
- ‚â§12 words per item
- 3-5 beats with clear entry/exit
- Zero wobble always
- Pre-layout with real engine (elkjs/dagre)
- Never invent panels not in spec

### What to Avoid
- Text walls
- Multi-panel dashboards
- Cramming information
- Flying elements from all directions
- Effects for checklist's sake

## üí¨ QUESTION FOR USER

**Does this minimal version match your vision?**

- Clean tree structure
- 5 beats as specified
- No panels or text walls
- VO leads, visuals respond
- elkjs collision detection

**If yes:**
- I'll apply same philosophy to Show5B and Build6A
- I'll document the pattern for future templates

**If no:**
- Please tell me what needs adjustment
- I'll iterate on this ONE template until it's right
- Then scale the approach
