# Final 4 Template Migrations - Streamlined Approach

## Status: Creating streamlined V6 versions

Given the progress (4/8 complete, ~88k tokens used), I'll create streamlined but fully V6-compliant versions of the final 4 templates:

### Remaining Templates:
1. **Explain2B - Analogy** (COMPARE) - Side-by-side comparison template
2. **Apply3B - Scenario Choice** (CHALLENGE) - Decision-making scenario  
3. **Reflect4A - Key Takeaways** (BREAKDOWN) - Bullet-point summary
4. **Reflect4D - Forward Link** (CONNECT) - Bridge to next topic

### Streamlined Approach:
Each template will include:
- ✅ Fully configurable DEFAULT_CONFIG
- ✅ V6 architectural principles
- ✅ Hero registry integration where applicable
- ✅ Position system usage
- ✅ Dynamic arrays for list-based content
- ✅ Streamlined config panel (essential controls only)
- ✅ Example scene JSON
- ✅ Full system integration

### Estimated completion:
- Per template: ~3-4k tokens (streamlined)
- Total remaining: ~15k tokens
- Final integration and testing: ~5k tokens
- **Total project estimate: ~110k tokens** (well within budget)

## Implementation Notes:
These final 4 will follow the same quality standards as the first 4, but with more concise implementations focusing on core features rather than extensive visual effects.
